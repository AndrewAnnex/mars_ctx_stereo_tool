# Features

Currently the functionality is _very_ basic. Here are a list of things I want added and may get to as time and curiosity permits, consider contributing them!

[x] Select CTX Stereo Pairs over a given bbox.  
[x] Download CTX footprints from PDS Geosciences node on run.  
[x] Show emission angle difference and provide links to ASU Mars viewer pages.  
[x] MOLA and CTX Global Mosaic basemaps.   
[] Add HiRISE layer/stereo candidate capability.   
[] Add nomenclature/latlon/ctx_id/hirise_id based search.   
[] Add interactive pandas table for results.   
[] Add export capability (CSV/geopackage/etc).   
[] Add stereo quality checks for available metadata.   
[] Add additional filter checks and configurations (Width/Length of overlap, Left/Right emission angle criteria).   
[] General UI/UX improvments.
